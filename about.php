                <p>Westside Motors needed a website being built for their new car hire company launch. They knew that young newly passed drivers wouldn’t 
get the benefit of hiring out nice cars to drive for maybe an event like a wedding for example. Knowing most car rental companies 
won’t hire out to anyone who’s under 25 or a newly passed driver. So they wanted me to create a website where it allows someone, 
anyone, to hire a car out even if they’re newly passed. We’d make sure that we would get an affordable insurance 
policy put in place considering they comply with the terms and conditions, that states they have to provide a weeks notice 
if they’re newly passed drivers.</p>
<p>

    However, Westside Motors did not want to base their target audience simply around newly passed drivers and people aged under 
25 trying to hire out a car. They want to broaden the audience by reaching out to different age ranges of people. With also having a 
broad selection of cars, it’ll attract a wide range of potential customers. This website will contain everything from a luxurious 
Rolls Royce to a small Toyota Yaris so no driver feels left out. This would be the dream haven of all car lovers.
